GDF-22 v1.0

Version 1.0 of this game will be fairly simple in execution; it will consist of a single level. Gameplay will be top-down instead of side scrolling, as the final functionality will be the same.

The game will have the following components:
-An introduction.
-The gameplay level.
-A stage boss.
-An ending.

Introduction: The intro will be simple for this first release - just text on a screen, depicing the story we’ve told.

Gameplay level: The level will be top-down in nature, and will only have a limited number of enemy types to deal with.

	Vulture (Enemy): Travels in packs/formations. They take two hits to destroy.
Narwhal (Enemy): Single fighter, tougher than the vultures. They fire single laser shots. They take four hits to destroy.

Stage Boss: At the very least, this guy will have a health bar.

	Theta Engine: He does shit.

Ending: More text, just like the intro.

Because we’re just a couple of dudes, some awesome game features will have to be put on hold until the next release of the game. Thus, the list below consists of all the features we want to add, but won’t this time:

-Obstacles, like asteroids or large ships.
-More than one level.
-Ridiculous graphics.
-Weapon powerups or any ship upgrades of any kind.
